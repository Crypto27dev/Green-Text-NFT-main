# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
npx hardhat verify --contract "contracts/GreenTextNFT.sol:GreenTextNFT" "deployed_contract_address" "addminaccount"
```
Deployed contract address: 0xd5576796772e02eaBEd801b37471ed51393aFc52
